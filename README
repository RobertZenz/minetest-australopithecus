Minetest - Autralopithecus
==========================

A sub game for [Minetest][minetest].

The long term goal of Australopithecus is to provide a vast, fun to explore
world that is hard to survive in. The player should be dumped into a wild world
that does not forgive any mistakes, leaving the camp and going into
the wilderness should always be an adventure.

The main sources of inspiration are [Minecraft][minecraft],
[Dwarf Fortress][dwarf-fortress], [Don't Starve][dont-starve],
[Diggles][diggles] and similar games.

[Australopithecus][australopithecus-wiki] is an extinct genus of hominids that
lived 4 to 2 billion years ago.
