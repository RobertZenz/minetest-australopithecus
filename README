Minetest - Autralopithecus
==========================

A sub game for [Minetest][minetest].

The long term goal of Australopithecus is to provide a vast, fun to explore
world that is hard to survive in. The player should be dumped into wild world
that does not forgive any mistakes, leaving the camp and going into
the wilderness should always be an adventure.

The main sources of inspiration are [Minecraft][minecraft],
[Dwarf Fortress][dwarf-fortress], [Don't Starve][dont-starve],
[Diggles][diggles] and similar games.

[Australopithecus][australopithecus-wiki] is an extinct genius of hominids that
lived 4 to 2 billion years ago.
