Minetest - Autralopithecus
==========================

A sub game for [Minetest][minetest].

The long term goal of Australopithecus is to provide a vast, fun to explore
world that is hard to survive in. The player should be dumped into a wild world
that does not forgive any mistakes, leaving the camp and going into
the wilderness should always be an adventure.

The main sources of inspiration are [Minecraft][minecraft],
[Dwarf Fortress][dwarf-fortress], [Don't Starve][dont-starve],
[Diggles][diggles] and similar games.

[Australopithecus][australopithecus-wiki] is an extinct genius of hominids that
lived 4 to 2 billion years ago.


Features
========

 * Custom mapgen with vast biomes, high mountains and deep oceans.
 * Grass spreads slowly.
 * Ramps are placed in the whole world.


Textures
========

Textures are from the awesome [Summerfields][summerfields] texture pack.


Mods
====

 * core - The core of the game.
 * mapgen - The mapgen.
 * torch - Torches.


Mods (external)
===============

 * [artisanry][artisanry], a replacement for the default build system.
 * [utils][utils], a util collection for Minetest mods.
 * [spawn-usher][spawn-usher], a system to place the player on spawns.
 * [voice][voice], a system that makes the chat behave more like a voice.
 * [worldgen][worldgen], a system for creating mapgens.
 * [worldgen-utils][worldgen-utils], a util collection for mapgens.


Next up
=======

The next few things that I plan to implement:

 * drop mod, everything that is mined should be dropped and then automatically
   picked up. This does provide valuable visual feedback to what's going on.
   This kinda depends on [#3107][3107].
 * Particle effects for torches are needed to make them not look like
   lightbulbs.
 * Once [#3095][3095] is implemented that torch can be simplified and the
   `torch_wall*` variants can be removed.
 * Most debug commands should be limited to admins.
 * Directly after the mapgen there are lighting issues.


Debug commands
==============

For the time being there are multiple commands available, mostly for debugging
purposes.

 * `/delete-map`, deletes the current map chunk which is automatically
   regenerated from scratch.
 * `/get-torches`, gives you a fresh set of torches.
 * `/reload-mapgen`, reloads the mapgen system. Only useful if you plan to test
   changes to the mapgen on the fly.
 * `/update-map`, updates the liquids and lighting in the current map chunk.


Feedback
========

I'm open for any feedback, or if you have any questions, either drop an issue
here, post in the [forum thread][minetest-forum-topic] or over IRC, I'm idling
most of the time in #minetest, #minetest-dev and #minetest-mod channels.
