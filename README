Minetest - Autralopithecus
==========================

A sub game for [Minetest][minetest].

The long term goal of Australopithecus is to provide a vast, fun to explore
world that is hard to survive in. The player should be dumped into a wild world
that does not forgive any mistakes, leaving the camp and going into
the wilderness should always be an adventure.

The main sources of inspiration are [Minecraft][minecraft],
[Dwarf Fortress][dwarf-fortress], [Don't Starve][dont-starve],
[Diggles][diggles] and similar games.

[Australopithecus][australopithecus-wiki] is an extinct genus of hominids that
lived 4 to 2 billion years ago.

   regenerated from scratch. Needs the `ap_mapgen` privilege.

   changes to the mapgen on the fly. Needs the `ap_mapgen` privilege.

I'm open for any feedback, or if you have any questions, either drop an issue
here, post in the [forum thread][minetest-forum-topic] or over IRC, I'm idling
most of the time in #minetest, #minetest-dev and #minetest-mod channels.
